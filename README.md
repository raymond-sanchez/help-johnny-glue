In January of last year my brother, John, was diagnosed with colorectal cancer. At the
time of diagnosis, he was at stage 3b. The day of his diagnosis, his tumor was very
large, and they had to perform urgent surgery to create a colostomy. He has been
through chemo and radiation therapy which did result in the tumor shrinking, but not
enough to do a resection of the tumor without taking the bladder and leaving him with a
permanent colostomy and urostomy. He opted not to do the procedure as he is hopeful
of returning to work once his treatment is over. Therefore, he continues with treatment in
hopes his tumor will shrink more so that surgery might be an option for him. Prior to
the cancer he did electrical work for a living but has not been physically able to work
since January 2024. He is hopeful he can return to some form of similar work when he
is medically and physically able. It is still not clear when this will be. Unfortunately,
without any income from employment, he is living on social security which is not even
enough for one person to survive here in Tucson, much less in Fortuna, California. The
cost of living is very high. He lives in a 10’ x 10’ studio which is in an area where it is
difficult to get to the grocery store or drug store. He has a vehicle, but it needs repair,
registration and of course insurance which does not make this an option currently. We
have been helping him as much as we possibly can, but it is not enough. He cannot
relocate at this point and although he has some neighbors who have helped, he is pretty
much on his own. He needs assistance with purchasing food, household items,
transportation as needed, and hopefully get his car running so he doesn’t have to
depend on others to go to the store, etc. No donation is too small. And if you cannot
donate, please share with others. Thank you for your support either way
